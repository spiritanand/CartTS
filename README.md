## CartTS

Implemented the functionality of cart using React and Typescript.

### Run Locally

1. `git clone https://github.com/spiritanand/CartTS`
2. `cd CartTS`
3. `npm init`
4. `npm run dev`
5. Open in preferred browser 

I am amazed at the capability and functionality typescript has. It makes the code a 
lot more robust for a bit of investment upfront.
